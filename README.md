**Project Title:** Vaccine Usage Analysis and Prediction

**Description:**
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of individuals taking an H1N1 flu vaccine using logistic regression. It involves analyzing a dataset containing various features related to individuals' behaviors, perceptions, and demographics, and building a predictive model to determine vaccine acceptance. The aim is to help healthcare professionals and policymakers target vaccination campaigns more effectively.

**Skills Takeaway From This Project:**
- Python scripting
- Pandas
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning

**Domain:**
Data Analysis and Machine Learning

**Problem Statement:**

**Tasks:**

**Task 1: Data Engineering**
1. Understand the complete dataset and engineer it as per the needs.
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the attributes.

**Task 2: Dashboard Development**
- Develop a Plotly or Streamlit analytical dashboard with at least 5 types of dynamic charts and at least 3 data filtering options.

**Task 3: Model Development**
- Train a logistic regression model (or any suitable model) for prediction.
- Perform model tuning and evaluation to improve predictive performance.
- Develop a predictive model to target vaccination campaigns effectively.
- Create a model serving API once the model is ready.
- Develop an application using Flask, Plotly, or Streamlit that can accept features as input and provide predictions to the end user.
- Host the application using any free hosting service provider.

**Project Evaluation Metrics:**
- Write code in a modular fashion (in functional blocks).
- Maintainability: Ensure the code can be maintained, even as the codebase grows.
- Portability: Ensure the code works the same in every environment (operating system).
- Maintain your code on GitHub (public repository).
- Include a proper README file for project development, including basic workflow and execution of the entire project.
- Follow Python coding standards (PEP 8).
