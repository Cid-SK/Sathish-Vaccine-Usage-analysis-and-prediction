# Vaccine Usage Analysis and Prediction

**Description:**
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of individuals taking an H1N1 flu vaccine using Random Forest. It involves analyzing a dataset containing various features related to individuals' behaviors, perceptions, and demographics, and building a predictive model to determine vaccine acceptance. The aim is to help healthcare professionals and policymakers target vaccination campaigns more effectively.

**Skills Takeaway From This Project:**
- Python scripting
- Pandas
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning

**Domain:**
Data Analysis and Machine Learning

**Problem Statement:**
Predict the probability of individuals taking an H1N1 flu vaccine based on their characteristics and attitudes. This can help healthcare professionals and policymakers target vaccination campaigns more effectively.

**Dataset Information:**
The dataset contains the following columns:
- unique_id
- h1n1_worry
- h1n1_awareness
- antiviral_medication
- contact_avoidance
- bought_face_mask
- wash_hands_frequently
- avoid_large_gatherings
- reduced_outside_home_cont
- avoid_touch_face
- dr_recc_h1n1_vacc
- dr_recc_seasonal_vacc
- chronic_medic_condition
- cont_child_undr_6_mnth
- is_health_worker
- has_health_insur
- is_h1n1_vacc_effective
- is_h1n1_risky
- sick_from_h1n1_vacc
- is_seas_vacc_effective
- is_seas_flu_risky
- sick_from_seas_vacc
- age_bracket
- qualification
- race
- sex
- income_level
- marital_status
- housing_status
- employment
- census_msa
- no_of_adults
- no_of_children
- h1n1_vaccine (dependent variable)

**Tasks:**

**Task 1: Data Engineering**
1. Understand the complete dataset and engineer it as per the needs.
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the attributes.

**Task 2: Dashboard Development**
- Develop a Plotly or Streamlit analytical dashboard with at least 5 types of dynamic charts and at least 3 data filtering options.

**Task 3: Model Development**
- Train a  suitable model for prediction.
- Perform model tuning and evaluation to improve predictive performance.
- Develop a predictive model to target vaccination campaigns effectively.
- Create a model serving API once the model is ready.
- Develop an application using Flask, Plotly, or Streamlit that can accept features as input and provide predictions to the end user.
- Host the application using any free hosting service provider.
